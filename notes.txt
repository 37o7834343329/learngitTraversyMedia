GIT COMMANDS:

git init : initialize local git repository

git add <file> : add file to index/staging area
git add *.html : add all html files

git status : what you have in staging area

git commit : commit changes in index
either:
i) git commit

git push : from local to remote repo(e.g. bitbucket, github)
git push -u origin master : ??

git pull : pull latest from remote repo
git clone : clone a repo in a new directory
git rm --cached index.html: to remove from staging area

git ignore: if you do not want something to be included add it in .gitignore

we usually do not want to include log files
here *.extension withdraws all the .extension files 

git branch name_of_the_branch:	just adds the branch,
								it does not switch the branch

git checkout name_of_the_branch: to switch the branch from whatever we are currently working on to name_of_the_branch

when we change branches, only those files are visible which belongs to that branch others simply vanish

git merge branch_name : this merges the branch to the branch that we are currently working on.
e.g.
if we write the above command in the master branch then new branch belongs to master

git remote : list the remote repository
git remote add origin url: adds the remote repository
